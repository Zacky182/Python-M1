# Ur.PET - Your Personal Expense Tracking Program
## General Info
Inspired by James Clear's book Atomic Habit, I created a Python program called Ur.PET. It is a simple Python program for tracking personal expenses. It realizes the value of building atomic habits by empowering users to set spending targets for the day and carefully record their transactions accordingly. Ultimately, users will receive a summary or notification indicating whether their spending exceeded the target or if they managed to save money. This fosters mindful spending habits and financial awareness, thereby contributing to long-term financial well-being.

### Features
1. Login: Users can log in using their credentials.
2. Set Target Expense: Users can set their target expense for the day.
3. Add Transaction: Users can add transactions with details such as date, category, amount, and description.
4. Remove Transaction: Users can remove transactions by specifying the transaction ID.
5. Update Transaction: Users can update existing transactions.
6. Summarize Expenses: Users can view a summary of their expenses for the day, including whether they have met their target expense.
7. Exit: Users can exit the program.

### Usage
To use Ur.PET, follow these steps
1. Run the main() function.
2. Log in with your credentials.
3. Choose from the menu options to set target expense, add, remove, or update transactions, summarize expenses, or exit the program.

### Dependencies and Environment requirements:
1. The code is written in Python, so it requires a Python interpreter to run. The code seems compatible with Python 3.x.
2. [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/): A Python library for formatting tabular data.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Zacky182/Python-M1.git
```
2. Install dependencies :
```
pip install tabulate
```
3. Run the application:
```
python ur_pet.py
```
